Gif homework

This homework assignment has to do with making AJAX calls to GIPHY API via a button which is created dynamically using jQuery.  The rules are to grab 10 images, which are in their static state, and to list their rating under each image.  
The buttons stay on the page, while the images are cleared for new ones.
When the images are clicked, they become animated, and when clicked again, they become static.
If you would like to donate to my cause, please let me know.

Enter the fruit you want, and a button will be created for you.  Keep adding as many buttons as you want. 
Once you are done, you can click any of the fruit buttons, and it will return 10 static GIF images for you, along with their rating.
You can click on the image to start and stop the animations!

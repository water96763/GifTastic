Gif homework

This homework assignment has to do with making AJAX calls to GIPHY API via a button which is created dynamically using jQuery.  The rules are to grab 10 images, which are in their static state, and to list their rating under each image.  
The buttons stay on the page, while the images are cleared for new ones.
When the images are clicked, they become animated, and when clicked again, they become static.
If you would like to donate to my cause, please let me know.
